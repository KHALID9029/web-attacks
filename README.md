# Web Attacks Project

This repository contains a set of intentionally vulnerable web applications developed as part of the **DVA495 Cybersecurity Fundamentals** course. The project is implemented using Node.js and aims to demonstrate various common web vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The repository is structured into three main branches, each showcasing different vulnerabilities contributed by various team members.

### Main Branch
This branch includes implementations of the following vulnerabilities:
1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
2. **Broken Authorization**
3. **Clickjacking**
4. **File Upload Vulnerability**

### CSRF Branch
The `csrf` branch provides examples of:
1. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
2. **Open Redirect**
3. **Command Injection**

### SSRF Branch
The `ssrf` branch primarily demonstrates **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** but also includes additional vulnerabilities such as:
1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
2. **Path Traversal**
3. **Port Scanning**
4. **Command Injection**
